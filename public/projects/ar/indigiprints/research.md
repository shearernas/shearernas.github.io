# AR as a Storytelling and Learning Tool Research

## How an AR Learning Tool Can Engage Users and Tell a Story
### Wei et al

Augmented Reality (AR) can allow users to experience and view virtual items integrated within their real world, which works well for grabbing and maintaining a student’s interest and attention within a learning environment.

AR experiences are recommended to be included within the normal teaching materials, as it “increases student’s learning autonomy”.

AR implementation is perceived as particularly costly, but it has generally also been seen as being very beneficial to any sort of educational or training environment, not just for educating students.
AR’s viability as a teaching tool for young students in school is still being evaluated, but the findings so far are very positive.

“The AR technology’s core benefits in education are assisting practical skills, spatial ability, and conceptual understanding, in addition to allowing inquiry-based activities (Cheng & Tsai, 2013). Furthermore, the technology helps to reduce the exorbitant cost of teaching resources such as laboratory equipment and supplies, in addition to providing a safe environment for unskilled learners to explore the potentially hazardous environment.”

## Location-Based Mixed and Augmented Reality Storytelling.
### Azuma, R.

When AR and Mixed Reality was starting to be developed in the 1990s, it was used for pretty much purely logical purposes (training for surgeons, maintaining large equipment) because of the primitive 3D technology and the absurd cost of developing the technology. 

As time and technology have progressed, AR has begun to be adopted as a valid medium for advertising, entertainment, education, and many more purposes.AR technology is much more portable and accessible, able to be run on a smartphone mostly.

Traditional medium for telling stories (films, books, etc.) are disconnected from where the audience is and AR allows the story to become connected to its audience’s current setting, allowing them to become more immersed and connected to the story being told.

Story telling is fundamentally important for us. “Telling a story is an important method of education and instruction. Stories can contain lessons, codified bits of wisdom that are passed on in a memorable and enjoyable form. Technological developments that make the story clearer and more memorable can aid retention and understanding.”

Robert Azuma concludes that there are 3 facets to AR storytelling that make it so effective as a legit storytelling medium:
· Reinforcing
· Reskinning
· Remembering

“In reinforcing, the AR storytelling strategy is to select a real environment, whether that is an object, person, or location, that is inherently compelling by itself, without
augmentation. Then, the AR augmentations attempt to complement the power that is
inherent in reality itself to form a new type of experience that is more compelling than
either the virtual content or reality by themselves.”

Reinforcing involves getting your audience to experience real emotions from your story by involving them within the story using location, for example.

By incorporating real life elements using location, the user can feel that the story is more grounded in reality, which can increase their immersion, the strength of the emotions they experience from the story, as well as their memory and retention of the story and its message.

“Many AR storytelling experiences that rely on the reinforcing strategy use the
technique of connecting the story to the past. Being able to increase the range of
stories that can be told through new AR and MR effects will require advancements in
our ability to track and augment historic outdoor environments. The Archeoguide
project (Vlahakis et al., 2002) was an early effort to develop a platform for augmenting archaeological sites.”

The strength in the “reinforcing” aspect of AR storytelling is that it does not rely solely on the virtual content of the AR program to tell a story. Incorporating elements of the real-life setting is a strength that AR storytelling can leverage, however it can also be a downside, as it can limit the user to a certain location or setting to maximize the effect of the story being told. A story that is location based oftentimes is tied to the characteristics of the real-life location.

*(Write about how IndigiPRINTS can reinforce the stories it tells without having to have the user located at a certain place, maybe with Thunder graphic novel?)*

Reskinning involves remaking reality with AR to fit the purpose of the story being told.
Reskinning allows a location to be irrelevant when telling a story in AR, unlike reinforcing.
Most of the power must now come from the virtual content of the experience.
This is more closely related to how IndigiPRINTS tells its stories.

Reskinning allows a story to be told at any location by transforming the location. Adding sounds, changing the viewport of the device, and generating virtual objects within the current environment the user is in are all methods that AR technology uses in reskinning to enhance the storytelling experience.
Remembering is the third aspect to approach AR storytelling with and involves retelling and drawing upon shared or individual memories. Using the location of where these memories happened adds to the strength and believability of the story being told.

Remembering is a more individualized and personalized experience. Sharing a story through AR allows the audience to create their own interpretation and memories of the individual AR experiences they participated in.

AR can also create stories based on the memories of others, regardless of the actual location of the user, and retell these memories through the perspective of the person telling the story.

## Emotion, explored in AR
### Van de Ven, B. 

Bram van de Ven created the “Oldskool” AR lens filter for Snapchat, which allowed users to create their own vintage stories through pictures they took using this filter. People from all over the world share their stories and inspire each other through the feelings of nostalgia the filter added to their photos.
Bram thinks that AR is a very powerful tool for sharing stories and expressing emotions. His AR Snapchat filter shows the viability that AR could have for expressing and sharing emotions, as his does with the nostalgia feeling.

## In the current remote and virtual environment, AR presents opportunities for learning.
### Thomas, M. 

AR can serve as a beneficial alternative to in-person learning and development programs.
“It can incorporate hands-on experiences, interaction and engaging tasks into an at-home training experience.”

Users of AR education show 75% higher knowledge retention rate as compared to more traditional education methods.

Users are retaining more of the knowledge they learned from AR and VR.

## How Virtual and Augmented Reality can transform enterprises today
### Ebbesen, H.

Immersive learning with AR can offer a hands-on experience that is customizable to a learner’s preferences.

This enhances the effect on not only cognitive memory but also muscle memory for certain applications.

## How VR & AR Can Affect Memory.
### Vstream

AR offers a way to engage with people in a new way that they are not desensitized to. Strong emotional experiences have a drastic impact on how well people remember an experience as well. Invoking a positive emotional response while we are processing information increases the chances that the information being presented is remembered well. AR also offers a way for people to create memories from scratch and connect their emotions to these new memories. An AR experience that stimulates multiple of our senses at the same time has a greater chance of its user encoding the experience as a strong memory.
