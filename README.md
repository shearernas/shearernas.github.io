# Nate Shearer's Portfolio

[**Follow this link here to view**](https://shearernas.github.io/)

This is my professional portfolio displaying my skills and past projects within information design, UX design, and some frontend development using React!

My portfolio is hand built in React using JS and Vite as the dev environment. I used some custom CSS and Tailwind 4 to handle styling and animations and things like that. 

Feel free to have a look at the backend code here and contact me if you have any questions through the contact form on my portfolio website [**here!**](https://shearernas.github.io/)
