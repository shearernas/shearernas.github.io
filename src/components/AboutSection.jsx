                        I'm an information designer who sees design as more than aesthetics â€” it's a tool for understanding, connection, and positive impact. My work combines user research, technical skills, and a genuine desire to make complex information accessible to everyone, regardless of their background or experience level.
                    </p>

                    <p className="text-muted-foreground text-md md:text-lg pb-3">
                        To the right are some skills and beliefs that I specialize in and use to fully drive my personal design process, from initial research to final implementation. I chose to pursue these unique skills and beliefs during my time as an information design undergrad student and hope to continue building on them after my time as a student has concluded.
                    </p>

                        If we get the opportunity to connect, you will find that I also value kindness and mutual recognition as key personal values of mine that I try to bring to every interaction I have with others.

                                    Why design for a target user group if your user isn't directly involved within your design process?

                                    User research and testing data is at the forefront of my design process and I believe that this philosophy can be used for much more than just UX/UI design. It is a core information design principle that I take very seriously, as you'll see within the majority of my core projects within my portfolio.

                                    Information design isn't used to make things look pretty to an audience, it should be used to disrupt a system and encourage change.
                                </p>
                                <p className="text-sm">
                                    I was taught that design should always be human-centred and used to bring forth positive change. Even though design can't solve every problem (there are some <em>very</em> complex problems out there), it can be used show connections between systems and structures within these problems, allowing us to better understand them and work towards solutions.

                                    Knowledge on complicated technical topics doesn't always have to be locked behind a paywall or an intimidating, 400+ page manual.

                                    I believe that technical learning tools should be universally accessible, using information design principles to allow anyone to learn these often complex topics as they would learn to ride a bike, regardless of previous experience or knowledge. Additionally, I am a strong believer in open source software and knowledgebases, which is why my side projects and research are always open source and transparent for anyone to benefit from.
