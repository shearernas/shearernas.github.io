# From my own use of the app

## Home Screen
- No indication of where to navigate to if you know exactly what you want to look for  
- "My Requests" seems like the best place to put the feature I plan  
- "Recent", "My Requests", and "My Favourites" all exist within the same menu but each have separate icons on the home screen  
- Even though the app feels a bit clunky, the interface is modern and clean  
- Icons look fine, there's enough contrast between them and the background  

## New Request Screen
- The categories for reports seem much better than they were when I last used the app  
- There is still a LOT of them all on one screen  
- Might contribute to choice paralysis or wasted time trying to find exactly what report might fall under just the right category  
- Selecting most categories brings up a "toast" notification indicating what a user could do to help minimize the amount of redundant reports  
- Most important text at the top is red, but still kinda blends in with the rest of the text on this screen  
- LOTS of text on this screen  
- I definitely felt a bit of decision paralysis trying to find what category my report falls under  
- Categories are centre-aligned, probably for hierarchy  
- Took me about 10 seconds of scrolling to find the right category to report for  
- When I tapped on the category, a toast pop up appeared:  
  >Direct access to Roads Streetlight Outage Reporting application is easy and streamlined. It promotes outage location accuracy, allows repair status review and escelation of concern is available.

- This pop up is unclear: what is the "Direct access to Roads Streetlight Outage Reporting application"?  
- Pressed "Ok" to go to the reporting screen  

## New Request Submission Screen
- Photo submission is at the top, which is good, presents most desired action right away  
- The link to the more streamlined service for reporting streetlight outages is underneath, I think I understand what that toast pop up was directing me to after seeing this  
- Still unclear though, I think this is a separate service?  
- Is it linked to the 311 reporting system?  
- There's no preview of where the link will take the user either, I was a bit hesitant to tap this link  
- Location is GPS/map based, easy to use and pinpoint report location  
- Description field under this is unclear; is this a description of the issue or the actual thing itself?  
- Submit button is at the very top; I had to look for it and missed it initially  
- Issue description consists of input field and drop down menu. I thought it was the field above?  
- Location description input field is clearly labeled; good  
- Clear loading toast pop up for problem submission  
- Returns you to the main menu, with a tiny little pop up at the bottom of the screen saying your problem has been successfully submitted  
- No other confirmation screen made me a little uneasy — where do I go next to check the status of my report?  
- Do I need to submit my name and email to get sent updates through email, like other people?  
- Beyond just me doing usability testing, I was genuinely confused on where to go next

## My Requests Screen
- This just felt like the natural progression to see where my report went after submission  
- "Orange" is used to categorize report status for **SUBMITTED**  
- Time submitted or viewed is next to the category label in small, muted text  
- User-submitted descriptions are below report picture and above status — hard to read because it's one big block of text with little separation between descriptions  
- No boldness or hierarchy among descriptions either  
- I checked back about 10 minutes later, my status changed from **Orange / SUBMITTED** to **Green / OPENED**  
- Time is next to status still but what does it mean? Time since report was submitted? Viewed? Acted upon?  
- Tapping on the report did not change anything from last time  
- I'm going to submit another issue but give my personal info and email to see if this allows them to give me detailed updates  
- Checking back about 30 minutes later, this request was given an SR number at the top of the screen that was cut off, as well as updated to **Blue / CLOSED**  
- No further details are provided anywhere that I could find besides “Completed – Close SR 21 minutes ago”; why was it closed? What does "Completed" mean?  

## New Request Submission Screen (Round 2)
- Followed the same report process as the first round but submitted my name, email, and phone number along with the request  
- Same result as other report at the "My Requests" screen  
- Did not receive any further emails or contact after report  
- I did get an email about an hour later:  

  > Thank you for reporting your city services needs. The information regarding a streetlight outage will be transferred to the streetlight outage map application within the next two business days. Please use the following link to check the status of the streetlight repair:  https://streetlightoutage.calgary.ca. 

- It seems like the City is really pushing for streetlight requests to go through this service
