                This project was a user research case study I completed as my final capstone project to end off my Information Design undergrad degree. The goal was to evaluate the usability of the City of Calgary's 311 app, which is used by residents to report issues and request services from the city.
              </p>
              <p className='text-start leading-relaxed px-4 py-2 text-black text-lg'>
                For this project, I had to pull out all the stops and apply everything I had learned in my undergrad degree, including user research, usability testing, and design thinking methodologies.

              <p className='text-start leading-relaxed px-4 py-2 text-black text-lg'>
                 To start, I began by organizing my research, defining my problem, and presenting my solution by creating a research dossier and project proposal, which you can have a look through below. My research here represents the greatest variety of first and second hand sources I've consulted, from official City of Calgary reports to asking citizens on Reddit.<strong> Considering my findings and initial research, I determined that the biggest issue with Calgary's 311 app was that Calgarians were left feeling excluded and frustrated by the lack of service request progress and helpful feedback from the City's end.</strong>

              <p className='text-start leading-relaxed px-4 py-2 text-black text-lg'>
                After defining my problem clearly, through a variety of real-world sources and opinions, I proposed my solution, which was to redesign the 311 app's interface and introduce a more visual and informative "service request lifecycle" that helps Calgarians stay informed on the progress of thier requests and keeps them satisfied and trusting of the City's 311 service.
              </p>
              <p className='text-start leading-relaxed px-4 py-2 text-black text-lg'>
                To get a good understanding of how the current 311 app works and how users interact with the app's interface, I used the 311 app for myself to report a couple infrastructure issues around my neighborhood. I then compiled my first hand findings, along with some observations on other people's use of the app, into a small Markdown document, which you can view below.

                Firstly, I wanted to get a good idea of what people think about the app's UI and how easy it is to navigate, as well as their thoughts on how effective my initial approach to the solution was. What better way to accomplish this than a card sorting activity and paper UI walkthrough, which is what I conducted with 4 participants and compiled into a FigJam board for ease of viewing below.

                The goal for this card sort activity was to understand the value my participants (average Calgarian citizens and users of the 311 app) place on report certain service request categories and how to represent these within the UI of the app itself (icons, colours, text, etc.), which with the results I would know how to start organizing the UI of the app to address some user's concerns of "choice paralysis" within the service request category menu. Additionally, I was able to determine how my participants would prefer the revamped system I had planned for a service request timeline.

                The next step was the meat and potatoes of this project: the usability testing. To facilitate a smooth and productive user testing procedure, I devised a protocol/plan to follow over the last 2-3 months of the project's lifecycle.

                With these results, I was able to start on designing the wireframe for the app using Figma. My wireframe went through 3 major reveisions, each backed with a round of first-hand usability testing with my participants. With each revision, I was able to learn about how my users appreicated the greater transparency of their service request's status in the City's hands, as well as how my users interacted with the wireframe to accomplish the tasks they were given.

                My capstone project was an incredibly satisfying end to my degree and a very valuable opportunity to showcase the information design skills that I'm most passionate about. Usability is incredibly important within our increasingly modernizing world and I believe it is an incredibly valuable outlet to keep out design decisions informed and grounded, serving our most valuable users within a sea of visual confusion and noise.
