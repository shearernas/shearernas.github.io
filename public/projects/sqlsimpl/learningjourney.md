# SQLSimple Learning Journey

## Analysis

**Identify the target learners**
Complete beginners with little to no prior technical knowledge or SQL knowledge that feel intimidated by learning programming

**Define learning objectives**
	- Introduce users to MySQL
	- Install and run MySQL
	- Create and manipulate a table within a database
	- Perform simple SELECT and JOIN queries using different criteria 
	  (WHERE, HAVING, IS, etc.)

**Assess learning environment constraints**
The main constraint will be those who feel discouraged or intimidated by learning a programming or technical topic. The learning environment will be asynchronously online, through a browser-based webpage interface, to allow ease of access.

**Determine what success looks like**
"Upon completion of this course, users will learn the basics background and theory needed to understand MySQL, how to install it onto their platform of choice, and how to create, modify, and query a relational table using the SQL querying language. Users will also be able to overcome their anxieties and barriers to learning a more technical topic like MySQL and will be equipped with the knowledge and skills to continue learning SQL beyond this course, should they choose to"

## Design

**Structure learning sequence**
The course will be structured as a series of 4 "modules", across both theory and practice halves. Structuring the content this way will break up learning into chunks so as not to overwhelm the user with the amount of content or topics available to learn.

Within each module, the topics will be structured in a particular order, based on prerequisite knowledge needed, as well as what makes logical sense to learn first. Modules will consist of 5-6 topics, depending on the complexity and content needed to cover within each module.

Each module will be laid out in a "step-by-step" operation. Each topic to learn will be presented as its own interface screen, Again, this is in an effort to introduce topics one by one and not overwhelm the user. Additionally, a template will be developed to apply to these individual learning topic screens to save time and apply scalability.

**Choose instructional strategies**
I have chosen to approach this "mini-course" using **Problem-based learning**, which serves to encourage and assess learning through students solving problems. The application will be split in two halves: **theory and practice**.
The theory half will involve actions such as:
	- Reading
	- Analysis
	- Thinking
	- Intake of information
The practice half will involve actions such as:
	- Answering questions
	- Typing queries
	- Solving problems
	- Applying critical thinking
	- Recalling knowledge from the **theory** portion

**Plan assessment methods**
Assessment will consist of a 6 question quiz based on content taught by the associated unit. 
Some examples of questions could be:
- Multiple choice questions, used to test theory knowledge
- Short answer "query" questions, used to test basic query knowledge and application
