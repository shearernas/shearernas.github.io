# My experiences with 2 IndigiPRINTS AR interactive stories

## Finding Victor

The AR aspect of this graphic novel displays some of the rough storyboarding that went into developing the final graphic novel.
It also displays videos documenting the final work for posing characters and the scene within Blender to create the pages of the finished graphic novel.

Sounds and music relating to the actions happening within the individual pages are also played through my headphones.
The AR aspect of Finding Victor does a good job at showing, not just telling, the hard work and talent that went into creating the story and art.

The added music and sound effects also really help to immerse me within the story happening on that specific page.

Every storyboard and video displayed through the AR portion of Finding Victor makes me feel emotions of sympathy, sadness, and lamenting for the protagonist, Victor.

Showing the rough draft and progress amplify these emotions because showing the work and care that went into telling Victor’s story makes it much more believable and allows the audience to really resonate with the characters and remember the story a bit more, as they were almost “included” within the conceptual process of creating Finding Victor.

At the end of the story, when Victor finds himself and his purpose through visiting with the Elders and taking in the natural beauty of his environment, while speaking to his late friend Liam, the added music in the AR app really enhanced the hopeful and bittersweet emotions expressed through the story.

## New Tribe Magazine Issue 6 Sixties Scoop

The AR aspect of this issue of New Tribe displays videos and links that give more background information and context to speakers and the topics covered by the magazine.

The front cover AR segment, featuring the audio of a television advertisement played over the video of a girl crying, brought about strong emotions of sadness and regret within me.

The audio taught me more about what really happened in the Sixties Scoop, like how Indigenous children were advertised to foster care and adopted into non-Indigenous families. I personally had no idea that things like this happened at all.

The YouTube link presented by the AR segment on page 9 displayed a CBC news report video from the 1960’s explaining the Adopt Indian Metis (AIM) program and how Indigenous and Metis children were marketed towards white families for adoption with a grant from the Canadian Government because the Saskatchewan Provincial Government who abducted them from their homes struggled to find them families away from their own original Indigenous families they were taken from. This shocked me and presented a story that I will remember and one that I feel quite compassionate and regretful about.

The AR-presented YouTube link to the video describing the history of the Charles Camsell Indian Hospital, where many Indigenous people in the past were transported to and screened for tuberculosis, often against their will, were attempted to be treated. Many did not make it out of the hospital alive and the video and page in New Tribe describe the abusive treatment they received from the nurses and care staff at the hospital. This video displayed through the AR segment of this page made me feel quite shocked, sad, regretful, and sorry for the experience these people experienced in the past.
